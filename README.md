# Natter - A Messaging App

A Messaging App where users can send messages to other users, create chat groups and access a Global chat that all users have access to and are able to send messages in.
There is also a 'Guest' feature where users can log in temporarily as a guest without needing to create an account, and can access most of the features in the Messaging App.
